# CPS305 Data Structures and Algorithms - Assignment

Find a path in an n by m matrix from a start cell to an end cell using certain restrictions/rules*same paragraph*
  If there is a path print the path, if there is not, print 'NO PATHS'
- Basic algorithm to find path was given
- Code for Queue was given (From text book; Data Structures, Algorithms & Software Priciples in C)

start = 's'
end = 's' 
empty = '.' 
occupied = 'o' 


e.g.

4 4*same paragraph*
osoo *same paragraph*
o..o *same paragraph*
oo.o *same paragraph*
e..o*same paragraph*
