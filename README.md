# CPS305 Data Structures and Algorithms - Assignment

Find a path in an n by m matrix from a start cell to an end cell using certain restrictions/rules 

  If there is a path print the path, if there is not, print 'NO PATHS'
- Basic algorithm to find path was given
- Code for Queue was given (From text book; Data Structures, Algorithms & Software Priciples in C)

start = 's'

end = 's' 

empty = '.' 

occupied = 'o' 


e.g.

4 4

osoo 

o..o 

oo.o 

e..o
