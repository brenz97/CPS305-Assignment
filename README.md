# CPS305 Data Structures and Algorithms - Assignment

Find a path in an n by m matrix from a start cell to an end cell using certain restrictions/rules \n
  If there is a path print the path, if there is not, print 'NO PATHS'
- Basic algorithm to find path was given
- Code for Queue was given (From text book; Data Structures, Algorithms & Software Priciples in C)

start = 's'\n
end = 's' \n
empty = '.' \n
occupied = 'o' \n

e.g. \n

4 4 \n
osoo \n
o..o \n
oo.o \n
e..o \n
