# CPS305 Data Structures and Algorithms - Assignment

Find a path in an n by m matrix from a start cell to an end cell using certain restrictions/rules <br />
  If there is a path print the path, if there is not, print 'NO PATHS'
- Basic algorithm to find path was given
- Code for Queue was given (From text book; Data Structures, Algorithms & Software Priciples in C)

start = 's' <br />
end = 's' <br />
empty = '.' <br />
occupied = 'o' <br />

======

e.g.

4 4 <br />
osoo <br />
o..o <br />
oo.o <br />
e..o <br />
